# M.A.A.M.Y's Chat Bot
Software Engineering Term 2, 2022

Our group has decide to create a chatbot using python. We have used the <a href="https://www.nltk.org/" target="_blank">***NLTK***</a> python Library in order to create our chatbot. The bot will be taking the role of a sassy, well educated, butler with a good scence of humour, meanwhile the user will take the role of its master. The bbroject has a simple input output system that works directly from the terminal, and is not very versatile, requiring exact input - Future revisions and additions could improve versatility. The bot is capabble of sustaining a simple conversation for a minimum of 30 turns. 

The MIT liscence is in this same direcory and is named <a href="https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Group-4-Maamy/chat-bot/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">LICENSE</a>. 

## Instalation guide
1. First, install <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/">pip</a> if you have not already
2. Run `pip install --user -U nltk`
3. Then, clone this git reposotory, or download the zip file. 
4. Inside the python directory, run the main.py file `python main.py`
5. Vouala - you now own a human soul.
