# M.A.A.M.Y's Chat Bot
Software Engineering Term 2, 2022

Our group has decide to create a chatbot using python. We have used the ***NLTK*** python Library in order to create our chatbot. The bot will be taking the role of a sassy, well educated, butler with a good scence of humour, meanwhile the user will take the role of its master. The bbroject has a simple input output system that works directly from the terminal, and is not very versatile, requiring exact input - Future revisions and additions could improve versatility. The bot is capabble of sustaining a simple conversation for a minimum of 30 turns. 

The MIT liscence is in this same direcory and is named LICENSE.
